# Unnamed Bomb Game

This is a prototype of a physics-based climbing game about a dwarf trying to escape a cave. He uses bags of bombs to propel himself through explosive blasts, launching through the cave in a chaotic attempt to reach freedom.

## How it was made

This game was made entirely by me in 1 or 2 weeks, using only Unity and C#. The sprites made by too.

## What I implemented

I tried to implement a realistic force physics in 2D. It needs more work in this version to work properly.
